# Statistics for Data Science

Sheil Sarda `<sheils@seas.upenn.edu>`

Taught by Prof. Hamed Hassani in Fall 2021.

## Course Description

The course covers the methodological foundations of data science, emphasizing basic concepts in statistics and learning theory, but also modern methodologies. Learning of distributions and their parameters. Testing of multiple hypotheses. Linear and nonlinear regression and prediction. Classification. Uncertainty quantification. Model validation. Clustering. Dimensionality reduction. Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. Such theoretical concepts are further complemented by exemplar applications, case studies (datasets), and programming exercises (in Python) drawn from electrical engineering, computer science, the life sciences, finance, and social networks.
